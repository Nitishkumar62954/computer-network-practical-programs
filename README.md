This repository contains Practical Examination Programs of Computer Network  along with their Outputs and this also contains Practical File programs mentioned in the list of Computer Network  Syllabus.

Question.1 (exam)> Simulate and implement go back and sliding window protocol.//////////// Go back and N is an algorithm that is a form of the sliding window protocol,In this algorithm, we have a fixed size window which is sending the frames in a window.Both sender and receiver agrees on some window size. If window size=w then after sending w frames sender waits for the acknowledgement (ack) of the first frame. As soon as sender receives the acknowledgement of a frame it is replaced by the next frames to be transmitted by the sender. If receiver sends a collective or cumulative acknowledgement to sender then it understands that more than one frames are properly received.

Question.2 (exam)> Simulate Cyclic Redundancy Check(CRC) error detection algorithm for noisy channel.////////////// CRC or Cyclic Redundancy Check is a method of detecting accidental changes/errors in the communication channel.CRC uses Generator Polynomial which is available on both sender and receiver side. 

Practical list programs:--
1> Simulate Cyclic Redundancy Check (CRC) error detection algorithm for noisy channel.
2> Simulate and implement stop and wait protocol for noisy channel.
3> Simulate and implement go back and sliding window protocol.
4> Simulate and implement selective repeat window protocol.
5> Simulate and implement distance vector routing algorithm.
6> Simulate and implement Dijkstra algorithm for shortest path routing.
